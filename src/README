This is a scape-goat tree

To build: javac Main.java
To run: java Main <absolute path to tree.txt OPTIONAL>

can also just copy tree.txt to this dir and the program will automatically detect it without needing to pass anything
into the arguments.

Use Java 1.8 otherwise it might not work. I am using a
switch statement on strings, which is a feature of java 
1.7 and higher.

Main.java - source code of the scapegoat tree along with the main function that parses the tree.txt and executes the
            commands
tree.txt - sample tree.txt file.
README - this file.
